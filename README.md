# Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based and digital businesses.
Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
The business needs a data-driven approach to understand customer behavior, identify
high-risk customers, and design effective retention strategies.

This project focuses on analyzing customer usage patterns, segmenting customers into
meaningful groups, and predicting customer churn to support proactive decision-making.

---

## Project Objectives
- Understand customer behavior through data analysis
- Segment customers based on usage and value
- Predict the likelihood of customer churn
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention

---

## Key Business Questions
- Which customer segments are most likely to churn?
- What behavioral factors contribute to churn?
- Which customers are high value but at high risk?
- How can the business prioritize retention efforts?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Churn Rate**: Percentage of customers who discontinue the service
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of customers who remain active over a given period
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimated long-term value of a customer

---

## Success Metrics
- **Model AUC-ROC**: Measure of the model’s ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers
- **Recall (Churn Class)**: Ability to correctly identify customers who are likely to churn
- **Precision-Recall Tradeoff**: Ensuring actionable predictions without excessive false alarms
