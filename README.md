# Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based and digital businesses.
Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, segmenting customers into meaningful
groups, and predicting customer churn using data science and machine learning techniques.
Insights are visualized through an interactive dashboard inspired by a professional SaaS-style UI.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem
- High customer churn negatively impacts revenue and long-term growth
- Businesses struggle to identify customers at high risk of churn
- Retention strategies are often generic instead of data-driven

**Proposed Solution:**  
A data-driven churn analysis system that:
- Identifies customers likely to churn
- Segments customers based on behavior and value
- Supports proactive and targeted retention strategies

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze customer usage and behavioral patterns
- Segment customers into meaningful business groups
- Predict customer churn using machine learning models
- Visualize KPIs and insights using a dashboard
- Enable data-backed retention decision-making

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions
- Which customer segments are most likely to churn?
- What factors contribute most to customer churn?
- Who are the high-value but high-risk customers?
- How should retention efforts be prioritized?

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Churn Rate** – Percentage of customers who discontinue the service
- **Retention Rate** – Percentage of customers who remain active
- **Total Customers** – Size of the active customer base
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – Long-term value of a customer

---

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Churn Rate Accuracy**
- **Recall (Churn Class)** – Ability to identify customers likely to churn
- **Precision–Recall Balance** – Actionable predictions with minimal false positives

---

## 🛠️ Approach Overview
1. Data collection and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature selection and engineering
4. Customer segmentation
5. Churn prediction using supervised ML models
6. KPI calculation and visualization
7. Dashboard design and frontend integration

---

## 🎨 Dashboard UI
- Designed following a SaaS-style layout
- Clean and minimal UI with KPI cards and charts
- Structured for future backend and ML integration

**Current Dashboard Features**
- KPI Cards (Churn Rate, Retention Rate, Total Customers)
- Churn & Retention Trend Line Chart
- Customer Segmentation Doughnut Chart
- Customer Input Panel (ready for backend integration)
