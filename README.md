# Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based and digital businesses.
Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project aims to analyze customer behavior, segment users into meaningful groups,
and predict customer churn using data science and machine learning techniques.
The insights are visualized through an interactive dashboard designed using Figma
and later converted into a responsive web interface.

## 🧩 Business Problem
- High customer churn impacts revenue and growth
- Businesses lack visibility into which customers are at risk
- Retention strategies are often generic instead of data-driven

**Solution**:  
A data-driven churn analysis system that:
- Identifies high-risk customers
- Segments customers based on value and behavior
- Supports proactive retention strategies

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze customer usage and behavioral patterns
- Segment customers into meaningful business groups
- Predict the likelihood of customer churn
- Visualize KPIs and insights using a dashboard
- Enable data-backed retention decision-making

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions
- Which customer segments are most likely to churn?
- What factors contribute most to customer churn?
- Who are the high-value but high-risk customers?
- How should retention efforts be prioritized?

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Churn Rate** – Percentage of customers who discontinue the service
- **Retention Rate** – Percentage of customers who remain active
- **Total Customers** – Active customer base size
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** – Long-term value of a customer

---

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **AUC-ROC Score** – Model’s ability to distinguish churn vs non-churn
- **Recall (Churn Class)** – Identifying customers likely to churn
- **Precision-Recall Balance** – Actionable predictions with minimal false alarms
